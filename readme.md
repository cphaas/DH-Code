# About me

Hello! My name is Carsten Haas - I'm with the Department of German, Nordic and
Slavic here at UW Madison

## Research Interests

I'm interested in the poetic traditions of the Old English, Old Norse,
and Old Saxon traditions, particularly with regard to the shift from 
an oral to a literate culture. In particular, I work with kennings (a
kind of poetic structure - a classic example would be to refer to the ocean
as the *whale-road*) and metonymy. If you would like to see some other kennings,
take a look at this [website](https://skaldic.org/skaldic/m.php?p=kennings "Get ready for some choice poetic content").

## Tools/Methods

I'm especially interested in learning about the following:
- Graphs
- Text Analysis
- TEI & XML
